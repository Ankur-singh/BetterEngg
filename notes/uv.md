# UV: Unified Python Package & Project Management

**UV** is a tool designed to streamline **package** and **project** management in Python, simplifying the complexities around package managers like `pip` and `conda`. It integrates Python version management and dependency management into a unified tool, making workflows smoother and more efficient.

## Motivation

In the Python ecosystem, multiple tools like `pip`, `conda`, and `poetry` overlap in their responsibilities, leading to fragmentation. Different tools work with different configuration files (e.g., *requirements.txt* for pip, *env.yml* for conda), and package authors may only support certain tools. To mitigate this, several PEP proposals later, the *pyproject.toml* has become the new standard. **UV** aims to leverage the *pyproject.toml* file to ease developer challenges by providing a single tool for both project and package management.

This README will guide you through the most common workflows in **UV**, how to think about UV, and how to use it to replace your current pip/conda setup.

## Installation

To install **UV**, follow the instructions on the [official installation page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

> **Note:** The examples here are from the official docs and provided for quick reference.

## Package Management Commands

These commands help you initialize and manage your Python projects, install/remove dependencies, and handle environment configuration.

### `uv init`
Initialize a new project in the working directory, or in a target directory by providing a name (e.g., `uv init new_project`).

### `uv add / remove`

- `uv add httpx`  
  Install the package *httpx*.

- `uv add "httpx>=0.20"`  
  Install with a version constraint (`>= 0.20`).

- `uv add "httpx @ git+https://github.com/encode/httpx"`  
  Install a package directly from a Git repository.

- `uv remove httpx`  
  Remove the *httpx* package from the project.

- `uv add -r requirements.txt`  
  Install dependencies listed in a *requirements.txt* file.  
  > **Note:** Not recommended because *requirements.txt* generally includes all dependencies along with the main packages. It's much cleaner to add only the required packages explicitly. **UV** maintains a separate *uv.lock* file to track package dependencies.

- `uv add --dev pytest, jupyter, ipykernel`  
  Install packages for development.

- `uv lock --upgrade`  
  Upgrade all packages in the project to the latest versions.

- `uv lock --upgrade-package <package>`  
  Upgrade a specific package to its latest version.

- `uv lock --upgrade-package <package>==<version>`  
  Upgrade a package to a specific version.

- `uv sync`  
  Synchronize a project with its dependencies, ensuring that a collaborator is using the same environment setup.

### Running Commands

- `uv run`  
  Run commands in the activated environment. **UV** automatically activates the environment when running commands, so no need for `source activate` and `deactivate` anymore.

## Important Files

These are the only two files that **UV** needs to re-create the exact same virtual environment every time. All **UV** commands (like `uv run`, `uv add`, `uv remove`, etc.) will make sure the virtual environment is in sync with the *pyproject.toml* file before performing any action.

> **Note:** Make sure you add these files to git.

- **pyproject.toml**  
  Configuration file used by **UV** to manage project dependencies. It lists allowed Python versions, packages, and their allowed versions.
  
- **lockfile**  
  A file that locks the project dependencies to specific versions.

## Python Version Management Commands

**UV** can also manage your Python version, not just the packages in your project. If no specific version is pinned, **UV** will use the default Python version installed on your system.

- `uv python find`  
  Finds first Python executable on your system.

- `uv python list`  
  List all available Python versions for your system.

- `uv python pin`  
  Pin a specific Python version for your project. This command will create/update the `.python-version` file.

  > **Note:** The version in the *.python-version* file should be allowed by the `requires-python` field in the *pyproject.toml* file. 
  
  Here's how to think about it: the *pyproject.toml* file specifies all allowed versions of Python, while the *.python-version* file specifies the specific version of Python to use.

- `uv run --python 3.12 pytest`  
  Run any command using a specific version of Python. This is great for scenarios where you want to run/test your code in multiple Python versions. Handy way to by-pass the pinned python version (if any).

## UV Tools & Speed

Because of how fast and easy it is to create disposable virtual environments, **UV** enables many new use cases that were previously not possible. 

- `uvx ruff format .`  
  Run one-off CLI tools without installing them. Great for tasks like code checks, formatting, linting, etc.

- `uv run --with vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct`  
  Run Python CLI packages, again, without installing them. Great for launching long-running servers or batch jobs.

**UV** creates the virtual environment, installs the requested tool, runs the commands, and deletes the virtual environmentâ€”all behind the scenes. It's so fast that you won't even notice it. Additionally, you can use the `--with` and `--python` arguments together for even more specific virtual environments.

## Conclusion

By migrating to **UV**, you can simplify your Python project management, streamline workflows, and reduce the complexity of using multiple tools. TBH, **UV** will make you rethink your previous practices, CI/CD, and other workflows.
